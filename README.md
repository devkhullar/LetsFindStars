# Data Visualization with DS9 + Find Stars with Photutils

This workshop is divided into two parts:
1. In part 1, we will be learning how to use DS9, a widely used imaging tool for astronomers to visualize all kinds of astronomical data, from pesky FITS files that have your science data to region files for your supplementary science. We will learn to make an RGB image of a galaxy on DS9, use some of the tools available in DS9 (creating regions, tiled images with locked coordinates, scaling parameters, etc). 
2. The second part of the workshop will use the galaxy that we investigated with DS9 to find the point sources in that galaxy (aka let's find stars) where I will provide an overview of the DaoStarFinder algorithm, I will demonstrate an example on the galaxy and then it will be your turn to find stars in another galaxy!
